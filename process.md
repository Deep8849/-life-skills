# Learning Process
____
## 1. What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.
* The Feynman Technique is a learning method where you deeply understand a concept by explaining it in simple words as if teaching it to someone else.

## 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
* One of the most interesting story in this video is her story about how she struggled with Math and Science when she was younger and later in life she deliberately she deliberately retrained her brain, eventually becoming an engineer and professor.
* The key takeaway is the approach to learn difficult subjects by using both focus mode(deep concentration) and diffuse mode(relaxing mode) allows the brain to make connection more effectively. 

## 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

1. Active Mode
- This is when you concentrate deeply on particular topic.
- In this mode, you can get stuck if you can't get a solution.

2. Diffuse Mode
- This is when your brain is relaxed and not actively thinking about that particular topic.
- It allows broader, more creative connections to form, often linking ideas in unexpected ways.
- It happens when you’re doing something else — walking, showering, or daydreaming.

## 4. According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
- According to the video, there are 4 steps to take when approaching a new topic.
1. Deconstruct the skill.
2. Learn just enough to self-correct.
3. Remove barriers to practice.
4. Practice at least 20 hours.

## 5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
- Applying techniques like the Feynman Technique and the Pomodoro Technique to understand concepts more deeply and retain them better.
- Minimizing distractions by avoiding the use of my phone during study sessions.
- Managing my time effectively so that I can balance focused learning with sufficient relaxation and breaks.
