# Good Practices for Software Development

## 1. Which point(s) were new to you?
- The point about joining meetings 5–10 minutes early to get time with teammates was new to me. 
- I hadn’t thought about how small interactions before meetings can help build rapport and improve communication. 
- Another new point was the suggestion to use tools like Loom, GitHub gists, or Codesandbox when asking questions, since these make explanations clearer and easier for others to understand.

## 2. Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
- I think I need to improve at over-communicating effectively. Sometimes I hesitate to immediately update my team when requirements change or when I face delays due to unexpected issues. 
- To make progress, I plan to:
   - Use group channels instead of private DMs so that communication is more transparent.
   - Make it a habit to send quick updates whenever there are blockers or changes in deadlines.
   - Be more proactive in turning on video during meetings to strengthen rapport with my team.
