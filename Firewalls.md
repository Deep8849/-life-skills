# Firewall

## Abstract
A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules. It acts as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks, helping protect systems from unauthorized access and threats. This paper provides a brief explanation of what firewalls are, their various types, their operational principles, and the importance of firewalls in maintaining network security.

## Introduction
- A firewall is a network security device that works as a security guard for your computer.
- It observes all the data coming and going. Based on some safety rules, it decides what to allow and what to block. 
- This helps to screen out hackers, viruses, and worms that try to reach your computer over the internet.

## Why Firewalls are important 
1. Stops Unwanted Access
Think of it like locking your front door — you don’t want       strangers just walking into your house. A firewall does the same for your network. It only lets in trusted traffic and blocks the rest.

2. Blocks Harmful Data
Just like a spam filter keeps junk out of your email, a firewall blocks dangerous or suspicious data from reaching your system.

3. Keeps Your Info Safe
A firewall helps keep personal and sensitive information hidden from hackers.

4. Protects from Attacks
If you leave your home unlocked, it makes it easy for thieves to do their work. The same goes for networks without a firewall; attackers can easily break in. A firewall ensures that doesn't happen.

## Types of Firewall
- Packet Filtering Firewall
- Stateful Inspection Firewall
- Proxy Firewall (Application Level)
- Circuit-Level Gateway
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)

## How Firewalls Work
- A Firewall works as a security guard for your network. It stands between your computer and the outside world.
- It monitors all data that comes from the internet to ensure only safe data is allowed through.
- When data tries to enter your network, it first passes through firewall, and the firewall examines the data packets using some predefined rules.
- Firewall allows the data packages if it is safe or blocks them if it suspicious.
- Alerts can be sent in real time if a major threat is detected.

## What Does a Firewall Actually Do?
- A firewall works as a gatekeeper for your network. It cannot allow every device to connect directly to the internet; all traffic has to pass through the firewall first. This helps to keep your computer safe.
- Firewalls protect against:
1. Outside threats like viruses, fake emails, DoS attacks, or hidden backdoors. They block bad traffic before it can reach your devices.

2. Inside risks like untrusted apps or people trying to send out data they shouldn’t. The firewall can stop this kind of traffic too, which helps prevent data leaks.

## Conclusion 
- Firewalls are very important for network security.
- Different types of firewalls are used as per different needs.
- They help prevent data breaches and unauthorized access.
