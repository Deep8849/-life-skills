# Listening and Active Communication

## 1. What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? 
- Pay full attention – Don’t think about other things, keep your mind on the speaker only.
- Show with your body – Nod, smile, keep eye contact so the speaker knows you are listening.
- Repeat in your own words – Say back what they told you, like “So you mean…?” This shows you understood.
- Ask simple questions – Ask things like “Can you tell me more?” to keep the speaker talking.
- Understand feelings – Notice how the person feels (happy, sad, angry) and accept it, even if you don’t agree.
- Summarize at the end – Quickly repeat the main points of what you heard to make sure you got it right. 

## 2. According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?
- Give Your Full Attention.
- Try to understand the speaker’s emotions and viewpoint.
- Reflect their emotional state—not just their words. Notice tone, body language, and emotion, and gently mirror that back through your reaction or words.
- Say back what they mean, not exact words, to show you understood.
- Don’t change the subject or bring in other issues.
- Keep listening, reflecting, and checking till both people are clear.

## 3. What are the obstacles in your listening process?
- My own thought distract me from listening.
- Thinking about what I will reply instead of fully listening.
- Getting distracted by my phone or other things around me.
- Losing focus when the topic is too long or complicated.

## 4. What can you do to improve your listening?
- Keep away distractions like phone or laptop while listening.
- Maintain eye contact and show interest with nodding.
- Take small notes so I don’t forget details.
- Practice patience—let the person finish before I respond.

## 5. When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day-to-day life?
- I become passive when I don’t want conflict, like agreeing even if I don’t fully agree.
- For example, when friends choose a place to eat and I don’t like it, but I still say “okay” to avoid argument.
- I also get passive in class or meetings when I’m unsure and stay quiet instead of asking questions.

## 6. When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?
- I get aggressive when I feel ignored or frustrated.
- For example, if someone cuts me in line or keeps interrupting me, I may raise my voice.
- Another situation is when I’m stressed and someone keeps pushing me, I react strongly instead of calmly.

## 7. When do you switch into Passive Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?
- I use sarcasm or silent treatment when I don’t want direct conflict but still feel upset.
- For example, if a friend is always late, instead of telling them directly, I might say, “Wow, you’re so good at being on time.”
- When I feel left out, I might not speak much and give short replies instead of sharing how I feel.

## 8. How can you make your communication assertive?
- Be clear and honest – Say what I feel directly instead of hiding it or exploding later.
- Stay calm – Keep my voice steady and avoid shouting or being rude.
- Respect others’ views – Assertive means expressing myself and respecting the other person.
- Practice body language – Maintain eye contact, confident tone, and open posture.
- Set boundaries – Politely say “no” when I cannot do something instead of over committing.
