# Tiny Habits 

## 1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The “Maui Habit” — saying “It’s going to be a great day” every morning when you put your feet on the floor.
- Why it’s interesting:
It’s super small but can shift your mood instantly.
That tiny positive start can lead to bigger, good habits.
Shows that real change begins with very small steps, not big struggles.

## 2. How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?
- To make new habits easier, you can:
1.Lower the bar on Ability: Make the habit so easy it’s almost impossible to skip.
2.Use a clear Prompt: Have a reliable reminder to get you started.
3.Don’t rely too heavily on Motivation, since it can fade—especially after the initial excitement wears off.
- MAP means:
  - M is Motivation — how much you want or are driven to do it.
  - A is Ability — how easy or possible it is for you to do it.
  - P is Prompt — the reminder or trigger that nudges you to do it.

## 3. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The story of the British Cycling Team. By making tiny 1% improvements in many small areas—like bike seats, sleep, and even hand-washing—they went from losing to winning the Tour de France. It showed me that small daily improvements can create huge success over time.

## 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?
The book says the most powerful way to build habits is by focusing on your identity instead of only goals.
- Don’t just aim for results like “I want to lose weight.”
- Instead, focus on the identity: “I am a healthy person.”

When you see yourself as the kind of person who does the habit, your actions naturally follow. Identity shapes habits, and habits reinforce identity.

## 6. How to make a habit easier to do?
Make the habit frictionless—remove obstacles so it takes very little effort.
- Break it into very small steps (e.g., read 1 page instead of a whole book).
- Prepare your environment (keep your running shoes near the door).
- Reduce the effort needed so that the habit feels almost automatic.

## 7. How to make a habit harder to do?
Increase the friction—add obstacles so it becomes inconvenient.
- Put temptations out of reach (keep junk food on a high shelf or don’t buy it at all).
- Log out of distracting apps so you don't need to type the password every time.
- Make the process time-consuming or less comfortable so you naturally avoid it.

## 8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
Habit: Reading 10 minutes daily.
Steps:
1. Make the cue obvious: Keep the book on my pillow so I see it before bed.
2. Make it attractive: Choose books I enjoy, not just ones I “should” read.
3. Make it easy: Commit to just 1 page per day (usually I’ll read more).
4. Make it satisfying: Track progress with a checklist or app and celebrate each day I read.

## 9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard, or the response unsatisfying?
Habit: Scrolling on my phone late at night.
Steps:
1. Make the cue invisible: Keep my phone in another room before sleeping.
2. Make it unattractive: Remind myself that late scrolling makes me groggy the next day.
3. Make it hard: Log out of social apps so logging back in feels like extra work.
4. Make it unsatisfying: Tell a friend I’m avoiding late-night scrolling, so I feel accountable.
